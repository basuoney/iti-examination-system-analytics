Procedure:     sp_StudentSubmitExam

Purpose:
    Allows a student to submit exam answers using LETTERS (A–Z) instead of Choice_IDs.
    The procedure validates student/exam alignment (latest intake, track, branch, course),
    enforces exactly 20 ordered answers, and records each answer mapped to the correct
    Choice row via (Qu_ID, choice_letter). Both Answer_Ch_ID and Choice_Letter are stored.

Parameters:
    @St_ID          INT           -- Student ID
    @Crs_ID         INT           -- Course ID (for cross-check with exam)
    @Ex_ID          INT           -- Exam ID
    @AnswerLetters  NVARCHAR(MAX) -- Comma-separated letters (exactly 20) ordered by question,
                                   -- e.g., 'A,B,C,D,...,T' (case-insensitive; trimmed)

Validations:
    ✅ Student exists
    ✅ Exam exists
    ✅ Student is in the latest intake and matches exam intake
    ✅ Exam belongs to the specified course
    ✅ Student’s track/branch match the exam’s track/branch
    ✅ Prevent duplicate submissions for the same (ST_ID, Ex_ID)
    ✅ Exactly 20 answers; each is a letter A–Z
    ✅ Exam has exactly 20 questions
    ✅ Each answer letter corresponds to a valid choice for that question

Data Effects:
    • Inserts 20 rows into dbo.Stu_Exam_Qup for the student’s submission,
      setting both Answer_Ch_ID and Choice_Letter (trigger guard preserved).

Output:
    • Returns a single confirmation row (Submitted=1, ST_ID, Ex_ID, Answers).

Notes:
    • If you later allow essays/TXT questions, extend to populate txt_answer for those types.
    • Time window validation is included as a commented block for easy enablement.

Usage Example:
    EXEC dbo.sp_StudentSubmitExam
         @St_ID = 101,
         @Crs_ID = 3,
         @Ex_ID = 7729,
         @AnswerLetters = N'A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T';
